def words_string(s):   # Define the function with a parameter s. This is your input string to be processed by this Python program, ie., list of separated strings/words from given sentence or text data set in question. The return type for our solution will always be an array (list) as per problem statement and we are not returning any specific value like 'None' etc because the output is a required result to solve your task which requires us to provide some sort of information back, hence it should ideally either print or store in something.
    return [word for word in s.replace(' ', '').split(',')]  # This line will split string by comma and space (if any) into list/array where each element is a separate words from the input sentence which we are returning as our solution to solve this problem, ie., task of splitting given text data set in question.
