Here is the Python code for your function. This uses list comprehension and built-in string methods to solve this problem efficiently, without needing a checklist or any additional logic in our program flow control structure (like if/else statements). The final output of `split_words` will be either an array with words split by whitespace ('Hello world!') into ['Hello', 'world!'], the number of lower-case letters that have odd order, 3 for "abcdef", or a message saying it cannot determine how to handle input.
