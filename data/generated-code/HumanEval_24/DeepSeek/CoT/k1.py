import math   # Importing Math module for using the Sqrt function in this code block, it is used to calculate Square Root. It's not necessary if you are only looking up divisors but I included here just as an example and a good practice when working with Python programming language itself or any other languages that use math functions such like Java etc
def largest_divisor(n: int) ->int :  # Defining the function to find out Largest Divisible number. It takes integer n, returns Integer type value ie., divides evenly smaller than 'N' and is greater or equal with N itself (i e ,largeset possible).
    """ For a given input `n` this method will return largest positive int that can divide the provided argument without leaving any remainder.  If no such number exists, it returns -1 as per Python convention for undefined variables/functions."""   # Docstring to describe what function does and its inputs & outputs in detail
    i = n-1                   # Initialize 'i' with value of `n` minus one because we need largest divisor which is less than the number.  (We are looking at all numbers till sqrt(N) for finding Largest Divisible Number).   It will be used to iterate from i towards n
    while math.sqrt(i)!=int(math.sqrt(i)): # Start a loop until square root of 'n' is not an integer, this means we have found the largest divisor which can divide `N` without leaving any remainder  (Largest Divisible Number) and also it will be used to iterate from i towards n
        if ((math.sqrt(i))%1==0): # Checking whether square root of 'n' is an integer or not, If yes then break the loop as we have found our largest divisor which can divide `N` without leaving any remainder (Largest Divisible Number) and also it will be used to iterate from i towards n
            return int(math.sqrt(i)) # Returning square root of 'n' if yes, else continue the loop until we find our largest divisor which can divide `N` without leaving any remainder (Largest Divisible Number) and also it will be used to iterate from i towards n
        i -= 1  # Decrease value by one in each iteration. This is done so that 'i' decreases till we find the largest divisor which can divide `N` without leaving any remainder (Largest Divisible Number) and also it will be used to iterate from i towards n
    return -1   # If no such number exists, then returns '-1'. It is done so that if there are not suitable numbers in the range till sqrt(n), we can handle this case.  (Largest Divisible Number) and also it will be used to iterate from i towards n
