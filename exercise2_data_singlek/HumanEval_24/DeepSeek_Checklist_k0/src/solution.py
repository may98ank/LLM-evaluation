def largest_divisor(n):   # For the given problem, this function will return 'largest divisible integer' for any input n. Here we start from highest possible value and keep reducing until find suitable one or reach 2 (as all numbers are even). If no such number is found then it means there isn’t a valid largest factor of that particular numeral
    while(n % 2 == 0):   # While loop will continue till n becomes odd. This condition ensures we'll get the smallest possible divisor which can divide 'N'. For example, if N = 36 (which is even), then it won’t find any suitable number to be a largest factor as all numbers from 1 upto sqrt(n) are already checked
        n = int(n /2 )   # Reduce the value of variable "num" by half. This will eventually lead us towards finding our answer which is 'largest divisor' or smallest possible number that can divide N evenly (i.e., remainder = 0).  For example, if we start with n=36 and reduce it till one becomes odd then the largest suitable integer would be "2"
    return int(n)   # Returning 'largest divisor' or smallest possible number that can divide N evenly (i.e., remainder = 0).  For example, if we start with n=36 and reduce it till one becomes odd then the largest suitable integer would be "2"
