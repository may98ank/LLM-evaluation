def words_string(s):   # Define the function with one parameter s which represents string of comma-separated or space separated elements to be split into an array/list, e.g., "Hi my name John" -> ["Hi", "my","name","John"] etc... . The list comprehension is used here for achieving this task
    return [word.strip(' ,')  # strip() method removes any leading or trailing characters (spaces and commas) from the given string, then it's added to our result array/list   if there are multiple separators in between words like "John," -> ["John"] etc...
    for word in s.replace(' ,', ',').split(',')]  # replace() method replaces all occurrences of a specified character (in this case, comma) with another specific one and then split the string into list using that replaced commas as separator e.g., "John," -> ["John"] etc...
