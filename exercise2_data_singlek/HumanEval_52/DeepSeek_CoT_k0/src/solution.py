def below_threshold(l:list , t : int) -> bool:   # Defining the function with type hinting. It takes a list and an integer (both required parameters), returns boolean value indicating whether all elements in provided array are less than threshold or not, as per given condition otherwise it will return false
    for i in l:# Iterating over each element of 'l' 
        if(i >= t): # If the current item is greater/equal to threshhold then we can break out from loop and say that all elements are less than threshold. Hence, returning False as per given condition  
            return false    # Returning FALSE after checking one by one because at least there's an element which isn’t below t in the list ‘l'. So it will not go to else part of if loop and hence returns true only when all elements are less than threshold. If any number is greater or equal then we don't need further checks so, returning false
    return True # Returning TRUE after checking every single element because no such condition was met in the above for-loop (i.e., none of them were below t). Hence it will go to else part and returns true only when all elements are less than threshold i.e we have checked each one beforehand so, returning True
